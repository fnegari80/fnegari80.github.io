Greetings. My name is Fatemeh Negari, I’m from Tehran, Iran. I was born on 9th August 2001. I have a solid background at mathematics and physics. I’m an active and committed student and have an inventive mind which my arts can be a proof to this fact. Speaking of arts, you can observe some of them at “My Arts” section. I think my innovation might be useful in my engineering career because I already had some wonderful ideas such as developing a MATLAB GUI to help us anticipate hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performance of a merchant ship, and developing a webpage that can help students to decide which engineering software course to participate based on their interests and needs, which I’m working on both with [my partner](https://amirhoseinjebeli.github.io/). I’m currently studying ocean engineering at Tehran Polytechnique and interested in Hydrodynamics, offshore platforms, energy saving devices and WECs.

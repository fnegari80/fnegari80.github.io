Greetings. My name is Fatemeh Negari, I’m from Tehran, Iran. I was born on 9th August 2001. I have a solid background at mathematics and physics. I’m an active and committed student and have an inventive mind which my arts can be a proof to this fact. Speaking of arts, you can observe some of them at “My Arts” section. I think my innovation might be useful in my engineering career because I already had some wonderful ideas such as developing a MATLAB GUI to help us anticipate hydrodynamic and hydrostatic performance of a merchant ship, and developing a webpage that can help students to decide which engineering software course to participate based on their interests and needs, which I’m working on both with my partner. I’m currently studying ocean engineering at Tehran Polytechnique and interested in Hydrodynamics, offshore platforms, energy saving devices and WECs.  

You can visit william’s guide if you want to make a page like this. But if you want to use the exact same format as this one for yourself, you can fork the repo from here.
